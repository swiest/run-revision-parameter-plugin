<div>
		Defines a run parameter, where users can pick a single run of a
		certain project. The SCM revision of that run will be used in the
		current build.
	<p/>
		Conceptually, this is the reverse of the options "Pass-through
		Git Commit that was built" or "Subversion Revision" for the
		Parameterized Trigger plugin. Here, the job B looks up the
		revisions to be used from a specific build of job A.
